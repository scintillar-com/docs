Scintillar aims to provide an open-source Web API and Toolsuite for game developers to build their games on top of. There are already very interesting Game engine projects (shoutout to [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) for the amazing recent developments), but what's still missing from the open-source gamedev ecosystem is a robust infrastructure for everything .
